# Recovering-Partially-Corrupted-Objects-via-Sketch-Guided-Bidirectional-Feature-Interaction
1. The data preparation process for constructing partially occluded object masks and partial sketches includes three steps: 1) Mask Generation 2) Partial Masking and 3) Partial Sketch Generation. We provide the code of generating the CUB-sketch test set and MSCOCO-sketch test equipped with single type sketch in generate_test_mask_pairs_of_cubbirds.py and generate_test_mask_pairs_of_mscocoval.py, respectively.
